abstract: "We present a scalable computing framework for the solution stochastic multiobjective optimization problems. The proposed framework uses a nested conditional value-at-risk (nCVaR) metric to find compromise solutions among conflicting random objectives. We prove that the associated nCVaR minimization problem can be cast as a standard stochastic programming problem with expected value (linking) constraints. We also show that these problems can be implemented in a modular and compact manner using PLASMO (a Julia-based structured modeling framework) and can be solved efficiently using PIPS-NLP (a parallel nonlinear solver). We apply the framework to a CHP design study in which we seek to find compromise solutions that trade-off cost, water, and emissions in the face of uncertainty in electricity and water demands."
