abstract: "We present a clustering-based preconditioning strategy for KKT systems arising in stochastic programming within an interior-point framework. The key idea is to perform adaptive clustering of scenarios (inside-the-solver) based on their influence on the problem at hand. This approach thus contrasts with existing (outside-the-solver) approaches that cluster scenarios based on problem data alone. We derive spectral and error properties for the preconditioner and demonstrate that scenario compression rates of up to 87% can be obtained, leading to dramatic computational savings. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed preconditioner can avoid scalability issues of Schur decomposition in problems with large first-stage dimensionality."
