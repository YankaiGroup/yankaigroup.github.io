summary: Kaixunâ€™s recent work was published in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). In this work, we proposed a new global optimization algorithm for clustering problems and demonstrated that our algorithm can solve the MSSC problem with up to 200,000 samples in parallel, while state-of-the-art approaches in the literature can only deal with two thousand samples.
